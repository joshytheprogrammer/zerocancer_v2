                    Zerocancer is a comprehensive cancer prevention initiative dedicated to minimizing the occurrence of new cases of cervical, breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Our multifaceted approach involves extensive awareness campaigns, public enlightenment, immunization, and screening initiatives. We firmly believe that early detection is key to effective treatment and, as such, we prioritize identifying individuals at high risk through thorough screening processes.

                <div>
                    <p>Our mission extends beyond awareness, as we actively support diagnosed cases in gaining access to the most affordable and appropriate care available. We strive to connect them with healthcare professionals in close proximity and facilitate collaborations with philanthropists and non-profit organizations engaged in cancer treatment. Recognizing that the majority of cancers are preventable or treatable if detected early, our overarching goal is to screen populations at risk, keeping them informed and facilitating opportunities for free or subsidized screening and immunizations.</p>

                    <p>
                        For those with the means to afford these services, immediate screening is encouraged. Leveraging the best available and affordable screening methods, individuals identified as high risk are closely monitored for prevention and early intervention. In cases where cancer is diagnosed, we ensure prompt referrals to the appropriate healthcare professionals for effective disease management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Zerocancer is committed to monitoring all high-risk cases, whether through individual, sponsored, or government programs. This approach ensures a continuous follow-up process conducted by assigned healthcare professionals, contributing to the best possible outcomes for those in need. Additionally, we play a pivotal role in helping non-profit organizations, governments, and donors identify and connect with specific population groups, communities, and associations for targeted interventions and outreach programs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In our collaborative efforts, we also engage with manufacturers, representatives, and vendors of cancer screening kits, devices, and equipment. Through these partnerships, we secure discounted products and services, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship where they gain publicity among our network while contributing to our mission of preventing and managing cancer effectively. Zerocancer is not just an initiative; it's a dynamic force that brings together various stakeholders to create a united front against cancer.

                            Cervical cancer is caused by some strains of virus known as <em>Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        The secret to early detection and prevention is <span class=" colorise">screening for the virus that causes it</span> or using a <em>tissue smear from the cervix (pap smear)</em> or <em>inspection of the cervix with chemicals (VIA)</em> to check women for early signs of the transformation process initiated by the virus.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        Detecting these viral strains is possible using either <em>DNA or antigen test</em>. More recently, certain <span class=" colorise">proteins produced by the strains of the virus</span> which cause the cancer, also called <span class=" colorise">Oncoproteins</span>, have been shown to give the most sensitive and accurate results of the presence of high risk of cancer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        <span class=" colorise">Rapid diagnostic test kits</span> which detect these proteins as well as the antigens are also available for the most accurate testing. These kits are <span class=" colorise">easy to use, very affordable</span>, and give <span class=" colorise">instant results</span>. An example is <span class=" colorise">Mobilab HPV 16/18</span> which detects both antigens and oncoproteins.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        To perform this test, a <span class=" colorise">sample of fluid from the woman's cervix</span> needs to be obtained. This sample is usually collected by a healthcare professional but recently <span class=" colorise">self collection devices known as Self samplers</span> have been introduced. The <span class=" colorise">Mobilab Delphi Vaginal Self Sampler (DVSS)</span> is one of such.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        The <span class=" colorise">video below explains how to collect self samples using the DVSS</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
                        The collected sample can be taken to the laboratory for testing or tested by self if the woman has the kit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="special-p ">
